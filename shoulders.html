                    You created something someone else used. When that someone received funds, they decided you should have some
                    too.
                    The funds you just got are a <i>portion of what they got</i>, yours because you helped make their work possible.
                    It's probably a small amount.<sup>1</sup>

                    If what you received is
                    significant, consider sending some to those whose work yours depended on.
                    We suggest a norm of keeping half for yourself and then sending half split among 1-5 creators that made your
                    work possible (take your best guess.)
                    You can send them this note too.
