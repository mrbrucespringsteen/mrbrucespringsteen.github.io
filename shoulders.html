        <p>
            You created something someone else used. When that someone recieved funds, they decided you should have some too. 
            The funds you just got are a <i>portion of what they got</i>, yours because you helped make their work possible. It's probably a small amount (for now?)<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
            type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">If what you received is significant, consider sending some to those whose work yours depended on. 
                We suggest a norm of keeping half for yourself and then sending half split among 1-5 creators that made your work possible (take your best guess.) 
                You can send them this note too.
