                    You created something someone else used. When that someone recieved funds, they decided you should have some
                    too.
                    The funds you just got are a <i>portion of what they got</i>, yours because you helped make their work possible.
                    It's probably a small amount (for now?)<sup>1</sup>

                                significant, consider sending some to those whose work yours depended on.
