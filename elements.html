      <p>Planck sold the first Science NFT for $24k. Here's what we did... and what we're doing next.</p>

    <center><h1>Abstract</h1></center>
      <p>

    Planck is an incentive system for open innovation using non-fungible digital manuscripts on Ethereum. We call these original manuscripts "Glyphs." Original manuscripts of important scientific and innovative works have long been uniquely valuable, and by initiating a novel incentive design around Glyphs we have developed a system to reward thinkers, innovators, and creators. Planck can be thought of as creating an “alt-patent” system; a non-legal framework for attribution and financial rewards for those who do time-consuming, valuable, knowledge work. We believe this is essential in the larger project of improving the knowledge commons, helping us all think and create together better.

              <dd><p> Aaron Swartz, co-founder of Reddit, was skeptical until he conducted his own experiments. <p/>
            <p> I’ve started taking a couple tablespoons of extra light olive oil and already I found myself skipping a meal, something I’ve never been able to do before. We’ll see how it goes. </p>
            <p> Later he wrote, “To our children, obesity will probably seem like just another relatively-rare disease, like a learning disability or a speech impediment.” Apr 26, 2006 </p>
            <p> AI Theoriest Eliezer Yudkowsky summed it up on the LessWrong forum: “Just drink two tablespoons of extra-light olive oil early in the morning… don’t eat anything else for at least an hour afterward… and in a few days it will no longer take willpower to eat less; you’ll feel so full all the time, you’ll have to remind yourself to eat”, She also noted that Seth’s diet swept “the econoblogosphere […] People including some respectable economists tried it, found that it actually seemed to work, and told their friends”</p>
            <p> Nassim Taleb may have been one of those respected economists. "So, if getting taste without calories makes people gain weight, let me try the opposite: to get calories without taste[ …], he wrote, careful to reject any claism of causality associated with the theory. “I don’t like to “explain”, provide “reasons”, or invoke some theory to accommodate academic imbeciles; I am just trying it to see what it does.” </p>
            <p> Soon, the diet went viral. It was covered enthusiastically in mainstream outlets like NYTimes and influential blogs, too, such as Steve Levitt’s Freakonomics, Alex Tabarrok’s Marginal Revolution and Andrew Gelman’s StatModeling. Seth Robert’s book, “The Shangri-La Diet: The No Hunger Eat Anything Weight-Loss Plan” became a national best-seller. </p>
            <p> Before passing away, Swartz assumed that there would be “clinical trials [to] demonstrate the effectiveness” of Seth’s theory… indeed, most naturally! Why not? </p>
            <p> The studies never came. Seth’s Appetite Theory was little-discussed even just 5 years after it’s original publication. It had not produced a single clinical trial since. </p>
            <p> By 2017, a decade had passed. Neurobiologist Stephan Guyenet was conducting a ‘ask-me-anything’ meeting on a website Aaron Swartz helped to build when someone asks Stephan about Seth’s old appetite theory. </p>
            <p> Guyenet replies “I don’t know what to make of it, and that opinion will persist until some sort of research is done on it, which is unlikely to ever happen.” </p>
            <p> Well, the unlikely happened. </p>
            <p> “Science is great, but it’s low-yield. Most experiments fail. That doesn’t mean the challenge isn’t worth it, but we can’t expect every dollar to turn a positive result. Most of the things you try don’t work out — that’s just the nature of the process.” </p>

              <p> P1anck is active in the field of innovation and discovery, where incentives are infamously poor (e.g. Nelson 1957). For our Open Science NFT Concept, we sought to consequential ideas that would otherwise go unfunded and unfound. Seth’s Appetite Theory was perfect because any experiment results concerning the theory could not easily be commercialized for profit (hey - it’s just good ol’ flaxseed oil!). </p>
<p> We arranged to hire Cate Babcanec, a public health PhD with experience in science and technology acquisitions, to help facilitate a clinical study. Excitement grew amongst researchers and statisticians on Reddit and Twitter as we crowdsourced a study design to test Seth’s theory. </p>
<p> <pre> “A small fragment of real science has entered the ring aimed
   at the entire official edicifice of prestigious science larping
   was unable to run a single study on for over a decade.
   “if this holds up — results looking good 0 —  this will be pretty
   insane… this could change, save millions of lives  all enabled by
   NFTs and if it doesn’t, it will be really cool science.” </pre><p>
