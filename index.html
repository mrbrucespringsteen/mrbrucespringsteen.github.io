        <h2>The Big Picture of what Planck is</h2>
        <p>
            Planck is an incentive system aimed at bettering the incentives around open innovation, antifragile
            tinkering, and the scientific production of knowledge.
            We do this by helping to create and organize digital manuscripts on a blockchain. Original manuscripts of
            important works have long been uniquely valuable,
            and by programming around such digitally scarce, non-fungible manuscripts (called Glyphs) we have developed
            an incentive system to reward thinkers, innovators,
            and creators. This incentive system can be thought of as “alt-IP”; a non-legal framework for attribution and
            financial rewards for those who do time-consuming, valuable, knowledge work.
            We believe this is essential in the larger project of improving the knowledge commons, helping us all think
            and create together better.
