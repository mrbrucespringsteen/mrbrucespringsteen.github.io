    <center><h1>Abstract</h1></center>
      <p>

    Planck is an incentive system for open innovation using non-fungible digital manuscripts on Ethereum. We call these original manuscripts "Glyphs." Original manuscripts of important scientific and innovative works have long been uniquely valuable, and by initiating a novel incentive design around Glyphs we have developed a system to reward thinkers, innovators, and creators. Planck can be thought of as creating an “alt-patent” system; a non-legal framework for attribution and financial rewards for those who do time-consuming, valuable, knowledge work. We believe this is essential in the larger project of improving the knowledge commons, helping us all think and create together better.

            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>

              </dt>
              <dd><p> Aaron Swartz, co-founder of Reddit, was skeptical until he conducted his own experiments. <p/>
            <p> I’ve started taking a couple tablespoons of extra light olive oil and already I found myself skipping a meal, something I’ve never been able to do before. We’ll see how it goes. </p>
            <p> Later he wrote, “To our children, obesity will probably seem like just another relatively-rare disease, like a learning disability or a speech impediment.” Apr 26, 2006 </p>
            <p> AI Theoriest Eliezer Yudkowsky summed it up on the LessWrong forum: “Just drink two tablespoons of extra-light olive oil early in the morning… don’t eat anything else for at least an hour afterward… and in a few days it will no longer take willpower to eat less; you’ll feel so full all the time, you’ll have to remind yourself to eat”, She also noted that Seth’s diet swept “the econoblogosphere […] People including some respectable economists tried it, found that it actually seemed to work, and told their friends”</p>
            <p> Nassim Taleb may have been one of those respected economists. "So, if getting taste without calories makes people gain weight, let me try the opposite: to get calories without taste[ …], he wrote, careful to reject any claism of causality associated with the theory. “I don’t like to “explain”, provide “reasons”, or invoke some theory to accommodate academic imbeciles; I am just trying it to see what it does.” </p>
            <p> Soon, the diet went viral. It was covered enthusiastically in mainstream outlets like NYTimes and influential blogs, too, such as Steve Levitt’s Freakonomics, Alex Tabarrok’s Marginal Revolution and Andrew Gelman’s StatModeling. Seth Robert’s book, “The Shangri-La Diet: The No Hunger Eat Anything Weight-Loss Plan” became a national best-seller. </p>
            <p> Before passing away, Swartz assumed that there would be “clinical trials [to] demonstrate the effectiveness” of Seth’s theory… indeed, most naturally! Why not? </p>
            <p> The studies never came. Seth’s Appetite Theory was little-discussed even just 5 years after it’s original publication. It had not produced a single clinical trial since. </p>
            <p> By 2017, a decade had passed. Neurobiologist Stephan Guyenet was conducting a ‘ask-me-anything’ meeting on a website Aaron Swartz helped to build when someone asks Stephan about Seth’s old appetite theory. </p>
            <p> Guyenet replies “I don’t know what to make of it, and that opinion will persist until some sort of research is done on it, which is unlikely to ever happen.” </p>
            <p> Well, the unlikely happened. </p>
            <p> “Science is great, but it’s low-yield. Most experiments fail. That doesn’t mean the challenge isn’t worth it, but we can’t expect every dollar to turn a positive result. Most of the things you try don’t work out — that’s just the nature of the process.” </p>

            <h1>Testing "Seth's Appetite Theory" the Web3 Way</h1>
          </header>
          <div>
            <p>


              <p> P1anck is active in the field of innovation and discovery, where incentives are infamously poor (e.g. Nelson 1957). For our Open Science NFT Concept, we sought to consequential ideas that would otherwise go unfunded and unfound. Seth’s Appetite Theory was perfect because any experiment results concerning the theory could not easily be commercialized for profit (hey - it’s just good ol’ flaxseed oil!). </p>
<p> We arranged to hire Cate Babcanec, a public health PhD with experience in science and technology acquisitions, to help facilitate a clinical study. Excitement grew amongst researchers and statisticians on Reddit and Twitter as we crowdsourced a study design to test Seth’s theory. </p>
<p> <pre> “A small fragment of real science has entered the ring aimed
   at the entire official edicifice of prestigious science larping
   was unable to run a single study on for over a decade.
   “if this holds up — results looking good 0 —  this will be pretty
   insane… this could change, save millions of lives  all enabled by
   NFTs and if it doesn’t, it will be really cool science.” </pre><p>

    <p> Then, we built a big website to recruit volunteers and explain the study. Of course, the design was shared upfront and the resultant data will be public. </p>
    <p> Web3 legend Zooko even promoted our study to help recruit volunteers. </p>
    <p> We randomized volunteers into a treatment and control arm as planned, thereby performing a randomized control trial (RCT), the gold standard of experimental research. </p>
    People volunteered to literally drink olive oil for five days to test a beloved but untested theory.
     People worked on this email protocol so I can continuously collect their results.
     People would get a survey 3x a day, clip that to their email, natural part of the day,
     got results back from volunters, analayzed them , agregated it and sold the results as $24,000 that funded the replication of the study.


     <p> Finally, Austin Griffith minted and distributeed ~160 “Open Science Astronaut” NFTs
       to burner wallets. These were given to people who participated in Planck’s Web3 Open
       Science RCT and comprised of clinical data visuals generated by amazing @dhiahop who
       plotted “Hunger” on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal one. The lower line
      is the local regression (Loess) of the “treatment” condition, the test of Seth’s Theory.
      I mean, just look at it up there. Elegant polynomial smoothing but with the low-fi charm
      of a cryptopunk. The NFT’s creation also auratically indexes the beginning of a journey that might take us to some very cool places.
      This is a beautiful thing.</p>


      <p> The Center for Open Science also owned one NFT, for a few exciting minutes as the first Open Source Science NFT went
        live for auction! Soon after, it sold for the mindblowing amount of 13 ETH ($24,000). </p>



      <p> More so than a dollar-denominated value, the NFT really symbolizes participation
        in the first randomized control test of Seth Roberts’ Appetite Theory. It is also
        the first “blessed” NFT, which means 10% of sales goes to the Center for Open Science.
        This sets a precedent of selling NFTs to pledge proceeds to them, an idea Vitalik
        recently lent legitimacy. Therefore, the NFTs buyers also participate in the study. </p>


        <p> Planck was able to sell the result by bridging a compromise between two types of people who might want to buy this NFT. <p>

        <p> The first type of buyer is a curator of science and innovation NFTs in the @Cooopahtroopa’s $value sense - this NFT would be a fine first edition in any such collection. The collector might find value in owning the internet’s first of many kinds:
        - first randomized study of Seth’s appetite theory
        - first successful crowdsourced citizen science study using #opensourcescience methods: it was published for review on a major stats blog and then participants volunteered online.
        - first crowd-funded replication of a study, which the NFT sale helps fun
        - and, of course, the first native NFT of a scientific study (and using solid web3 methods, at that) </p>

        <p> The second type of buyer may only want to fund the replication of Seth’s theory, knowing that buying this NFT would help accomplish this. These buyers value the study for simply having been run. </p>

        <p> Consider what’s motivating these buyers. They have not seen the full results before they purchased the NFT. They are rewarding a study based on its design and subject matter! This is called “results blind science” and it can help alleviate publication bias.
          One type of buyer we did not concern were those who may want to fund the replication of the study, but worry that the original study’s results might change their mind. They may want to see the results beforehand. Until we hear from these types of buyers, we will disregard them as an edge case. </p>

              <h3>Firsts</h3>
              <dl>
                <dt>

                  <p> With the Open Science Astronaut NFTs there were and continue to be a lot of firsts. </p>
<p> 1. The first randomized study of Seth’s Appetite Theory, one that Aaron Schwartz,
veritable saint of the open web, thought would change the world </p>
<p> 2. The first successful crowdsourced citizen science study: the study design was openly published for review on a major stats blog and the participants volunteered online, a solid Web3 methodology </p>
<p> 3. The first NFT sale that helps crowd fund a replication of a study.
Historically, great knowledge is valued like great art. Bill Gates paid $40 million for Leonardo Da Vinci’s Codex Leicester. Einstein’s manuscripts sell for millions. </p>


<p> And a single page of Darwin’s writing fetches hundreds of thousands of dollars[…] People buy Darwin’s original pages because they are connected to his idea — the fact that information from The Origin of Species is freely available is not a bug for its high value; it’s a feature. Today’s Darwin would type The Origin of the Species in a Google Doc or a versioned LaTeX file. But now, with Planck, and the digital scarcity blockchain enables, she would create a unique Glyph [NFT] that serves as that first manuscript copy. </p>

<p> This “science as art” argument received some validation (for $24,000). <p>
<p> Custom art from @dhiahop (he made my av) who works in NiftyInk so it was a natural fit.

The NFT’s creation also auratically indexes (h/t @MPtherealMVP ) the beginning of a journey that might take us to some very cool places.

The provenance of ownership includes Planck and The Center for Open Science.  </p>

                <dt>

                  <p> Now, we are auctioning off an NFT as a small test of the SplitStream, and incentive design for funding science through citations. </p>
<p> We have been testing ways in which funds and proceeds from NFTs can be channeled to improve science funding more broadly. 10% of that will go to @OSFramework and the remainder will fund a full replication of the study. The aim, ultimately, is to enable progress and to try to help save some of the consequential ideas we might otherwise lose. These funds will help us run a replication of the study we ran. Here is something nice that a very smart person said about the project: we are auctioning off an NFT as a small test of the SplitStream, and incentive design for funding science through citations. </p>

                <dt>


                  <p> It’s important to keep in mind the bigger picture here though. We hope Seth’s theory is true (who wouldn’t?), but our fundamental concern regards the incentives themselves. </p>
<p> An NFT for a crowdsourced, pre-registered experimental design is an extremely cool idea with (potentially) profound implications. Hosted a study design competition to ensure it’s the best test it can be. we are funding a replication for an idealized design. </p>
<p> We’re also gonna host a competitions for the replication design and the top three entries will go on my mirror domain. This is called a “pre-registration” and is one of the most important steps in experimental science. https://cos.io/initiatives/prereg (and yes of course the brilliant study designer who wins will get proceeds from the sale!)</p>

                  <p> Now here’s what’s cool about this design. </p>
<p><strong> Biased against finding a result in favor of Seth’s Theory. </strong>  If you’re in the treatment condition you have to go two hours without eating or drinking anything. Thus you should actually be hungrier than if you’re in the control treatment (these people get to eat whenever). So if we find that the treatment makes people less hungry this would be extra surprising. </p> <p><strong> Semi-blinded. </strong>Those who haven’t read carefully about Seth’s actual theory might not know which condition they are in. E.G. if some in the control think it’s just about the olive oil itself then they will believe themselves to possibly be in the treatment.</p> <p> <strong> Exploratory Data Analysis. </strong> A commitment to Graphic Visualization and Simple Regression helps alleviate “garden of forking path” problems in analysis. The actual study is just graphs of the data and a handful of very, very basic regressions that are effectively exploratory. </p>

                  <p> It’s important to keep in mind the bigger picture here though. We hope Seth’s theory is true (who wouldn’t?), but our fundamental concern regards the incentives themselves.</p>

                  <p> When we first wrote about using NFTs as a unique way to fund science, Seth’s was one of the major motivating cases. Here’s how the simplest mechanism was intended to help fund such research: </p>
                  <p> <strong> 1. NFTs with high-potential: </strong> for citation are sold as scientific works of art.</p>
                  <p><strong>2. NFTs valued (by citation): </strong> are similar to a collectible could grow in stature and value as scientific work was validated. </p>
                  <p> <strong> 3. Validation funded by NFT sales: </strong> Prospective NFT sales of early scientific results could thereby profitably fund the validation of that research. As mentioned earlier, our current project is bearing this out: Planck crowdsourced the first ever randomized control trial of Seth Roberts’ appetite theory, sold an NFT of the result, and are now using the proceeds to run an independent lab replication of the findings. </p>

              <h3>Results Blind Science</h3>
              <dl>
                <dt>

                  <p> <strong> 1. Experimentation </strong>
                  <p> There are people who would like to value the study simply for having been run. I call “results blind science” and it can help alleviate publication bias. Reward a study simply based on the design and subject matter. But so these people need to credibly have not seen the full results <strong> before they buy. </strong></p>

                  <p><strong> 2. Results May Vary </strong></p>
                  <p> Other people may want to fund the replication but worry these results might change their mind. These people would want to see the results beforehand. For now, I’m going to regard these people as an edge case unless I hear otherwise. If you’re truly one of these people DM me. At least for now, if you’re in the “results blind science” camp you have some time to make a bid that will credibly signal your willingness to reward a study simply for its subject and methods. </p>

                  <p><strong> 3. Proof of Concept</strong></p>
                  <p> We believe this is a big step in “open” science that will allow methods and data to be “shared” without having to give the information away. This allowed @statsmartin and I to independently validate @stephensonhmatt test of Seth Roberts’ appetite theory. Proceeds are going toward the replication of Stephenson’s study. </p>

Cooperation on twitter got people excited, through reddit, got some cooperation, built a big website to recruit volunteers, explain the study, I randomized people into a treatment and control with a study design that I made with cooperations with other statisticians, worked on this email protocol so I can continuously collect their results </p>

                  <p> Stream of citations, this can help fund earlier research - this is what we’re trying on Mirror today. </p>
                  <p> 2 stats professors are selling an NFT, They’re going to send funds back down to what made it possible including the NFT I sold already. The person who is holding that will get some portion of the funds. If they chose to send it back, Planck will get a small amount as well, which we keep building to our replication. Start thinking about what this moves forward, with a split back, with a wind up, holding some of these NFTs, that’s the sort of interesting thing we’re playing with. What we’re working toward. </p> 
                  <strong> <p> Giants on Giants </strong> </p>
                  <p> You might know the quote “If I have seen further, it is from standing on the shoulders of giants”. You might also know that it’s from Isaac Newton, a giant if there ever was one. </p> 
                  <p> So in science, giants tend to look down and see other giants. Citations, when they work, map those dependencies backwards through time. Citations on citations. Giants all the way down. </p> 
                  <p> If you send funds through these citations, you get a cascade. A stream of splits. A SplitStream. </p> 
                  <p> Here’s what it looks like: </p>
                  <p> 1. We are running a test of this today as we help auction off an NFT of an independent data analysis of Seth’s Appetite Theory.
                  <p> 2. The analysis was conducted by two esteemed professors of statistics, Harry Crane and Ryan Martin, and thus the NFT is theirs with proceeds directed according to them. </p>
                  <p> 3. As a part of this independent analysis we were able to demo a powerful cryptographic technology from Aleo which we believe will be very useful to further open science.</p>
                  <p> 4. We used a Zero-knowledge Proof in Leo to enable the statisticians to effectively “query” our dataset and see certain results without revealing the data itself.</p>
                  <p> Because we are still learning how to use Leo (and because we will share the dataset publicly anyway!) we <strong> demonstrated this tech on a subset of results </strong> and outside the demo further tests were run.</p>

                  <strong> <p> Independent Analysis </strong> </p>
                  <p> Thus we value Harry and Ryan’s contributions greatly and have requested that they keep 50% of the NFT sale. They have also agreed to test the SplitStream and for the purposes of this incentive test, their analysis “cites” two NFTs: The NFT of the Open Science Test of Seth’s Appetite Theory (currently owned by Molecule) </p>
                  <p> The NFT of this Essay Outlining the Protocol (owned by Planck). </p>
                  <p> Planck will then split our proceeds further to what we are citing: 1. Mirror because we are using their amazing platform and tech. 2. This Artwork is Always on Sale, suggested by Simon De La Rouvier as the proper target for the citation of his shared idea of Harberger taxes for NFT ownership (which is an important aspect of our protocol.) </p>
                  <p> We encourage the recipients of these proceeds, if they are at all substantial, to split back to those they would cite. Let’s also note that this is a simple test of the mechanism and certainly does not represent the full range of actual citations we would use. Here is their NFT, an elegant violin plot of the results from the study we ran:

                  <strong> <p> 3. Mao Effects </p> </strong>
                  <p> As a trained academic, I could hardly discuss a mechanism like the SplitStream without noting some potential pitfalls. Properly done, this has great potential to reward an effective division of labor in for open science and more. But it does not create obligations, or promises, or contracts, or anything like that. </p>
                  <p>Participants are playing, roughly speaking, a live trust game. And in fact, these incentives cannot become too enshrined and formal because citations are a fragile system. Referencing Mao Effects, a person’s inspiration is purely their private knowledge and thus it must be shared voluntarily. A system which can’t elicit honest attributions will fail.</p>
                  <p>For example, you could imagine that many people might appreciate being credited as the essential inspiration for a new Nobel-prize winning discovery in physics. Someone with sufficient resources, some prestige-hungry Jeff Bezos, might even be willing to pay for that honor.</p>
                  <p>And then, of course, there’s nothing to stop our Nobel-winning physicist from claiming that her passing conversation with the dear leader Bezos was the fundamental inspiration for everything. Who could say otherwise? This sort of thing is absolutely going to happen sometimes, just as it sometimes happens in academia.</p>
                  <p>I’m going to call these types of behaviors “Mao effects”: the seeking of favor from those with status or power by over-attributing to them. Mao of course was named the “great helmsman”, the “great leader”, etc. and anything good that happened was often attributed to him.</p>
                  <p>A network overtaken by these Mao effects breaks down, a Ponzi-scheme for those who claim complete originality. In an evolutionary simulation it roughly looks like this: These effects can get more subtle as well. I can’t do much more here than sort of gesture at this and signal that I take these ideas seriously (e.g. I actually coauthored a Behavioral Economics literature review called “When Do Monetary Incentives Backfire”). </p>
                  <p> But a simple step toward preventing Mao Effects is observing the following two rules: (1)Favor citing things which are publicly shared. (2) Favor citing things which also cite. The first condition helps provide a level of transparency and sense-making to the system. So, for instance, you can understand why I cite Mirror because you can clearly see that I’m using their tech. The second condition helps ensure that cited works offer further attribution to the work they’ve built on. Together these rules help ensure that a would-be Mao openly shares their knowledge while also citing that which contributed to it.</p>

              <h3>The Industrial Revolution</h3>
              <dl>
                <dt>

                  <p> Seeking the “civil society patch” for Internet Technology. In the preceding sections, we’ve discussed the ways in which Web3 might enable the sharing and preservation of ideas. It only seems fitting to close this discussion with a small, highly speculative idea of our own. </p>
                  <p> <strong>1. The First Industrial Revolution (“IR 1”)</p> </strong>
                  <p> The famous one, occurring a little before the year 1800. It connected people with railroads and steamships and yet, despite its fame, it brought almost no growth: Instead, it took many decades until anyone saw the “big bang” wave of growth that we learned about in grade school, the one that ushered in the modern world. </p>
                  <p> This big bang growth actually appeared alongside a second wave of major inventions, quite distinct from the inventions of IR 1. Whereas IR 1 brought us together with connecting inventions like the steam engine, the second wave had the great livability innovations in areas like heating, sanitation, electric lights, elevators, motion pictures, etc. </p>
                  <p> The IR 1 world was a newly connected one, but it was also polluted and dangerous and kind of miserable. And we didn’t actually produce much growth all huddled together, drinking dirty water and breathing fumes. But then, once we figured out how to make this newly connected world more livable and pleasant, things got vastly better. Only then did we get the growth explosion that the Industrial Revolution is famous for. </p>
                  <p><strong> “IR 1.1” </strong></p>
                  <p> In this light then, rather than seeing the second wave of inventions as an IR 2, we might see them as the civil society patch: IR 1.1. </p>
                  <p> Before the patch it just wasn’t that pleasant to all live together but after the patch, suddenly, it wasn’t so bad. What if the same thing is true now? You can read top economists today pondering over the stagnant growth and missing productivity of the internet era dating back to the 1970s. But so too might an economist during IR 1.0 have puzzled over the missing productivity that the steam engine should have wrought. </p>
                  <p> What if today’s economists are wrong for the same reasons — what if the internet is indeed revolutionary and we just haven’t gotten the 2.1 patch? The internet brought our minds together in a great network to rival the 19th century network of railways and steamships. If this 1800s network could take you to undeniably thrilling — but also crowded and disgusting — cities, perhaps the internet too feels a bit like this now. It’s thrilling but awful, alluring but somehow inhumane. And so some optimism is available in the story of the 19th century, and the fact that its network showed a lot of promise but failed to deliver for a very long time until, suddenly, it did. </p>
                  <p> Let’s dare to hope that an even greater change awaits us once we figure out how to live and think together online. Structuring, rewarding, and preserving promising ideas seems like a step in the right direction. </p>
