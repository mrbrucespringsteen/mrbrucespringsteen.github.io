        <h2>The Big Picture of what Planck is</h2>
        <p>
            Planck is an incentive system for open innovation.
            We do this by helping to create and organize digital manuscripts on a blockchain. Original manuscripts of
            important works have long been uniquely valuable,
            and by programming around such digitally scarce, non-fungible manuscripts (called Glyphs) we have developed
            an incentive system to reward thinkers, innovators,
            and creators. This incentive system can be thought of as “alt-IP”; a non-legal framework for attribution and
            financial rewards for those who do time-consuming, valuable, knowledge work.
            We believe this is essential in the larger project of improving the knowledge commons, helping us all think
            and create together better.
